"Why This Works" Explanation: Explain the underlying logic and reasoning that makes your code solve the problem. 
Focus on the core concepts and principles your solution utilizes.

This works because I used a while loop to keep looping the string array until it reaches the 
last character that is not a space and give me the index of it. If there is only space 
characters, then I will get index -1. Then, I used a if else statement that if the index I 
got is -1, then I will make the first character in the array into null. Else, I will make the 
array index number that I got (that is not -1) and add +1 into the index number and make it 
into null, so it will cut off all white space after the index.
